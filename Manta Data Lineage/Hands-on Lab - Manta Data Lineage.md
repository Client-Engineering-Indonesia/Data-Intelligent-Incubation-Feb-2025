## What is Manta Data Lineage?
Data lineage is an essential component of an effective data management strategy and data governance practice that provides tremendous benefits:

1. Traceability - Where does data originate from, how has it changed over time, how is it being consumed, and by whom
2. Trust in data - Visibility, transparency, and trust into the journey of data to produce accurate and quality analytical and AI outcomes
3. Regulatory compliance - Meet government and industry regulation obligations to truthfully respond to compliance audits and inquires
4. Impact analysis - Assess and understand the downstream impact of planned changes before they negatively impact business processes
5. Root cause analysis - Accelerate data incident identification and remediation by quickly and effectively isolating the cause of the problem
6. Data platform migrations - Sort out the assets that need to be migrated and which ones can be ignored, saving time, money, and resources
