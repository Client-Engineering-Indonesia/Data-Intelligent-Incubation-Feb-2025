## Overview Manta Data Lineage
Knowledge Catalog in conjunction with IBM Manta allows data practitioners to augment data assets in a catalog with business metadata, business lineage, and technical data lineage for all stakeholders to understand the provenance of data, how it has changed and moved over time, how it's being used.

Business users can view a high-level summary of business lineage and associated metadata: business terms and data quality scores.
Technical users can view advanced data lineage details: technical, indirect, column level, and historical lineage.

## Benefit Manta Data Lineage
Data lineage is an essential component of an effective data management strategy and data governance practice that provides tremendous benefits:

1. Traceability - Where does data originate from, how has it changed over time, how is it being consumed, and by whom
2. Trust in data - Visibility, transparency, and trust into the journey of data to produce accurate and quality analytical and AI outcomes
3. Regulatory compliance - Meet government and industry regulation obligations to truthfully respond to compliance audits and inquires
4. Impact analysis - Assess and understand the downstream impact of planned changes before they negatively impact business processes
5. Root cause analysis - Accelerate data incident identification and remediation by quickly and effectively isolating the cause of the problem
6. Data platform migrations - Sort out the assets that need to be migrated and which ones can be ignored, saving time, money, and resources
