# Welcome to Data Intelligence Workshop by IBM
###### *Conducted on Feb 5, 2025.*

### Workshop Overview
Data intelligence is how organizations combine data management and metadata management principles with advanced tools —such as artificial intelligence and machine learning— to understand how their data is produced and used. Put another way, data intelligence helps organizations answer core questions about their data, including:
- What data does the organization have? Why does this data exist?
- Where did the data come from and where does it reside? 
- Who is using data? How are they using it—and how should they use it for best results?
- How are distinct datasets related to each other?
<br>
### Workshop Objectives
In this workshop, data leaders will learn key principles and best practices for enhancing data intelligence within their organizations. 
- First, you will explore how to **assemble data assets** from across your enterprise, **perform AI-powered metadata enrichment** with predefined or custom properties, and **organize them** into well-governed catalogs.
- Second, you will learn how to implement ***user access management** and **safeguard sensitive information** using policies and data protection rules.
- Third, you will take a deep dive into strategies for consistently delivering **high-quality, trustworthy data**.
- Fourth, you will see firsthand how to define **relationships between data** assets and explore **data lineage**, which can be used for impact analysis and error tracing.
- Lastly, you will be introduced to best practices for **data productization**, enabling high-quality data to be easily discoverable and accessible through a marketplace-like platform.
