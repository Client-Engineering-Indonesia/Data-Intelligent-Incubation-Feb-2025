# Data Product Hub
IBM Data Product Hub empowers data producers to publish curated data products for easy access by data consumers within their community. This lab introduces the critical features of Data Product Hub, demonstrating its capabilities in data sharing across an organization and automating the delivery of data products for users of all skill levels. Integrating with various source systems, Data Product Hub simplifies the onboarding of data products, regardless of their origin. Data producers can package, operationalize, and share reusable data products such as datasets, AI models, and notebooks. Business users and other data consumers can quickly discover these curated data products and receive them in a format optimized for their needs, reducing friction and improving enterprise data quality, reliability, and discoverability.

# What is a Data Product?
A data product is a composite entity that encapsulates one or more curated data assets designed for reuse and broad distribution. Unlike traditional data assets in governance catalogs, data products are governed through a lifecycle that includes stages such as Draft, Published, and Retired. This lifecycle management ensures that data products are always in a state that maximizes their business value and usability. Data products can include datasets, AI models, notebooks, and more, each thoroughly described with metadata to aid discoverability and usability.

# Lab Scenario
Management has observed a decline in order fulfillment rates and increased shipment times, which has resulted in consumer complaints through surveys and customer care channels. To address these concerns, an analytics project has been initiated to conduct a comprehensive investigation to identify the root causes of the significant drop in customer satisfaction over the past year.

To address management's concerns and successfully deliver this project, the following tasks will be performed:
1. Data Product Request
2. Request Acceptance
3. Creation
4. Publish
5. Subscribe and Use

## Personas
### Data Producers
Data Product Hub provides producers with full control over the data product lifecycle. Producers are responsible for creating, publishing, and updating data products to maintain compliance with data quality and security standards. Additionally, producers can enforce governance by defining data-sharing policies and establishing service-level agreements (SLAs) that address access restrictions, delivery mechanisms, and product retirement criteria.

### Data Consumers
Data Product Hub streamlines the process for consumers to find the information necessary to fulfill their business requirements. Consumers can efficiently search through collections of data products and access data from a wide range of sources within a secure environment, thanks to Data Product Hub's integration capabilities with both IBM and third-party tools. The platform also ensures data products are optimized for large-scale sharing across various consumers and consumption endpoints.

## Shopping for Data
In this section of the lab, you will assume the role of a Data Consumer. Your task is to find a suitable data product to fulfill a request from management. Specifically, you need to locate a data product that addresses the Employee Effect on Customer Satisfaction use case, which is central to the analytics project. This project aims to identify the root causes of declining customer satisfaction, with a focus on order fulfillment rates and shipment times. To support this investigation, the analytics team requires access to employee and warehouse staff data for decision optimization analysis and enhancements to the executive dashboard.

1. Login as data consumer

2. Enter Customer as search terms or characters in the search field to discover data products that may uncover insights related to the decline in customer satisfaction.
   Immediately, Customer Demographics and Sales appear, which aligns with the use case. Selects this data product to see if it meets the requirements.

## Requesting a New Data Product
Data Consumers can create a data product request tailored to their specific business needs. In the request, consumers can specify exactly what type of data they need, the format they prefer, and any specific data sources to be used. They can also indicate how they would like the data delivered and how often it should be refreshed. Additionally, they can outline who can access the data and any confidentiality agreements or data retention policies.

Once the request is submitted, producers review the details to make sure they understand the requirements. They might contact the consumers to clarify any points. After confirming the requirements, producers create the data product to meet the specified criteria. When the data product is ready, it is delivered to the consumer in the agreed-upon method, making it available for their business use.

1. Click on the Request a New Data Product button in the top right corner of the screen
   <img width="1728" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/433be350-0f72-4c7b-a995-fb3e185f936f" />

2. This will take the requestor to the New data product request form. The requestor must fill out the required fields and click the Submit button to create the request.
